# lc3as from lc3tools in posix shell
Hello world works fine. But it's still not complete.
## Motivation
This project is not serios or something.
I needed to kill some time because of having nothing to do for school a weekend, therfore decided to learn lc3 (hex code) and write a assembler for it in posix shell.
